## Hey there, fellow tech people!ðŸ‘‹

I'm a recent graduate from WGU with a Bachelor's in Computer Science.

I'm currently working on the game Knight and Slime, which you can check out below. If you're interested, I'm looking for collaborators (especially an artist). (updates are no longer consistent as I'm working full-time)

You can reach out to me at my dev email: onceaknight611@gmail.com
